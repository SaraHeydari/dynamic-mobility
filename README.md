# dynamic-mobility
This repository contains code for combining different data types in order to estimate temporal inter-regional mobility in Finland.

The order that the scripts should be run is shown in scripts_running_orde.pdf

Notice that one of the datasets (the mobile phone dataset) is privatre and thus can not be shared. As a rsult, the Jupyter notebook
compare_weekly_error_full_version.ipynb and compare_weekly_error_demonstration_version.ipnb are not functional and are shared merely
to make it easier to replicate such a study.
